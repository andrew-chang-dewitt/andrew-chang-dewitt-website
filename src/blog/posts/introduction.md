Just a quick introduction to the goals of this blog:

1. Share completed projects
2. Document works in progress
3. Discuss problems I've had difficulty with & what solutions I've found

I intend to start with a more detailed post about the making of this website,
as well as some other projects I've completed previously. As I write those,
I'll likely be posting some information about a few upcoming projects,
including a recipe web-app to make it easier to browse & share all of my
existing recipes
[currently stored on Trello](https://trello.com/b/QZWokYmb/cooking) in
addition to a budgeting app for my wife & I to use since we found we don't
like anything else we've used so far. Later, I hope to finally get some
work done on a home security system starting with the Raspberry Pi based
sensor modules I've built in Python & re-building it in Rust, then adding
control panels & alarm state logic using a microservices architecture.
