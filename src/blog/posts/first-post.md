This is a blog post.

It's not interesting.

# A header

Some more information. It includes

> a block quote
> about nothing.

And some really bad `code`, if you want to all it that.

```typescript

import { Something } from 'something'

// highlight-start
Something.wow((wowzers) => {
  console.log('a string' + wowzers)
// highlight-end
})
```

As well as an unordered

- list
- of
- nonsense

and an ordered

1. list
2. of
3. more
4. nonsense

and a link [to Google](https://google.com), I guess.
