      - "Utilized Trello's API to get content from the board we already used to store all of our recipes"
      - "Implemented [a custom graph data structure utility](https://andrew-chang-dewitt.dev/blog/posts/implementing-graphs-in-typescript) for representing relationships between questions"
      - "Developed a Result type (similar to [Rust's enum](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html)) to encapsulate success & failure states"
      - "Planning on converting to a back-end API with a database populated from Trello using API hooks that parses recipes into more granular detail to allow for abstractions on ingredient types, time, yield, & other recipe characteristics"
