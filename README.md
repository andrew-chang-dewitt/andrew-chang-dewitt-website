# andrew-chang-dewitt.dev

Personal website to host a resume, portfolio, & blog; all with the purpose of documenting/demonstrating my skills for potential employers.

This website is built with Gatsby in Typescript & SASS with the blog posts written in Markdown. 

To build the website, just clone the repo & run `npm build`, or `npm start` if you want it built & served for demonstration purposes. Both use Gatsby's CLI commands `gatsby build` & `gatsby serve` under the hood.
